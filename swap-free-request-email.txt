Subject: Request to Convert Account to Swap-Free Before Trading Account Opening

Dear Tickmill Support Team,

I hope this email finds you well.

My name is Sheikh Zahidul Islam, and I have recently completed my account registration and KYC verification with Tickmill.

Before proceeding to open my trading account, I would like to request that my account be converted to a swap-free (Islamic) account in accordance with Shariah principles.

Account Details:
- Name: Sheikh Zahidul Islam
- Email: fx@sheikhzahidulislam.com

I would appreciate it if you could process this request at your earliest convenience so that I may proceed with opening my trading account under swap-free conditions.

Please let me know if you require any additional information or documentation to complete this conversion.

Thank you for your assistance, and I look forward to your prompt response.

Best regards,
Sheikh Zahidul Islam
